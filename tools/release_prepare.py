"""Prepare a release: changelogs, their headings, and the version, in one step.

Usage::

    release_prepare.py X.Y.Z              # the next version, explicitly
    release_prepare.py major|minor|patch  # bumped from the current one
    release_prepare.py --list             # which packages a release touches, and which never

A release touches only the packages that are released: those whose ``package.xml`` carries the
current version. Every other package in the workspace -- the examples, the ``*_test`` packages,
the simulation helpers, the tools, the libraries kept out of the ROS build farm -- is fixed at
``0.0.0`` and is not a version this script will ever write. That is what keeps a release to the
files that have to change, and it is checked: a package at any third version is refused.

For each released package, in order:

1. the ``Forthcoming`` section of its ``CHANGELOG.rst`` is filled from the git history since the
   last version tag (``catkin_pkg``'s generator, over the released packages alone -- the CLI
   ``catkin_generate_changelog`` would create changelogs for the packages that have none);
2. that heading becomes ``X.Y.Z (today)``;
3. ``<version>`` in its ``package.xml`` becomes ``X.Y.Z``. Nothing else carries a version:
   every ``setup.py`` reads its ``package.xml``.

The result is a working tree to review and commit; the tag is pushed after the merge, by the
release gate. ``catkin_prepare_release`` does not apply to this repository -- it requires a
literal ``version='X.Y.Z'`` in every ``setup.py``.
