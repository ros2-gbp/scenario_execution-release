"""Where a scenario has got to, read from the log its own behaviour tree writes.

Which action is running, how long it has been in it, and what already finished --
``behaviors.jsonl`` holds all of it, and nothing could read it back. Useful for watching a run
progress, for checking afterwards that it did the steps it was meant to, and for looking at one
that is not doing what you expected; a scenario between status changes prints nothing at all, so
the log is the only thing that knows.

**It reports, it does not judge.** An action that has been running for minutes may be exactly
right: scenarios wait -- for a topic, for a duration, for a robot to arrive. Nothing here calls
that wrong, and a caller that wants a verdict has to bring its own expectation of what this
scenario should be doing.

The sibling of :mod:`scenario_execution.introspection` and deliberately not part of it:
that module answers *static* questions ("what does this environment offer", "what does
this file reference"), which are true before anything runs. This one answers a *runtime*
question about one particular execution, and mixing the two would make a module that is
sometimes about a file and sometimes about a process.

**Why the whole file has to be read.** The log is a metadata line, then a snapshot of every
node at timestamp 0, then **one record per behaviour whose status changed** -- see
:mod:`scenario_execution.utils.bt_logger`. So the current tree is the snapshot plus a fold
over every later record; the last line alone says only what changed last, which may have been
a long time ago. That cost is why this is a question a caller asks when it wants the answer,
rather than something cheap enough to poll.

Reads nothing but the file it is given, and imports nothing but the standard library: no
py_trees, no middleware, no simulator. A run that is misbehaving is when its environment is
least trustworthy, and that is one of the times someone reads this -- so needing the runtime to
import would make it unavailable in the case it is most wanted.

Runnable as a module so a caller outside the container can parse its JSON::
