   Overview of Scenario Execution

Scenario execution is built as a Python library on top of two open-source components: the generic scenario description language `OpenSCENARIO DSL <https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_DSL/v2.2.0/index.html>`_ and `PyTrees  <https://py-trees.readthedocs.io/en/devel/introduction.html>`_.
In general, the user defines a scenario in the OpenSCENARIO DSL language, scenario execution parses the scenario, translates it to a behavior tree, executes it and finally gathers the test results.

   Architecture of Scenario Execution

Our implementation is highly modular separating the core components from simulation- and/or middleware-specific modules realized through a plugin-based approach. 
In principle, any additional feature that is required by a specific scenario and that can be implemented in Python could be realized as additional library.
A library typically provides an OpenSCENARIO DSL file with additional definitions and may provide code implementing additional functionality such as conditions or actions.

Currently, the following sub-packages and libraries are available:

-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution`
-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution_ros`
-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution_gazebo`
-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution_control`
-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution_interfaces`
-  :repo_link:`scenario_execution_rviz`


Design for Modularity
---------------------

Scenario execution is designed to be easily extensible through libraries.
An example is available here: :ref:`scenario_library`.

The entry points are defined like this:

.. code-block::

  entry_points={
   'scenario_execution.actions': [
       'custom_action = example_library.custom_action:CustomAction',
   ],
    'scenario_execution.osc_libraries': [
        'example = example_library.get_osc_library:get_example_library',
    ]
  }

Scenario Parsing
----------------

   Architecture of Scenario Parsing

The Internal Model Builder, implemented as a Model Listener does an initial check of the model by checking for supported language features. The Internal Model Resolver, implemented as a Model Visitor is used for type/variable resolving and does an in depth consistency check of the model.


Modules
-------

- ``scenario_execution``: The base package for scenario execution. It provides the parsing of OpenSCENARIO DSL files and the conversion to py-trees. It's middleware agnostic and can therefore be used as a basis for more specific implementations (e.g. ROS or step-based simulation). It also provides basic OpenSCENARIO DSL libraries and actions.
- ``scenario_execution_ros``: This package uses ``scenario_execution`` as a basis and implements a ROS2 version of scenario execution. It provides a OpenSCENARIO DSL library with basic ROS2-related actions like publishing on a topic or calling a service.
- ``scenario_execution_control``: Provides code to control scenario execution (in ROS2) from another application such as RViz.
- ``scenario_execution_coverage``: Provides tools to generate concrete scenarios from abstract OpenSCENARIO DSL scenario definition and execute them.
- ``scenario_execution_gazebo``: Provides a `Gazebo <https://gazebosim.org/>`_-specific OpenSCENARIO DSL library with actions.
- ``scenario_execution_interfaces``: Provides ROS2 `interfaces <https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces.html>`__, more specifically, messages and services, which are used to interface ROS2 with the ``scenario_execution_control`` package.
- ``scenario_execution_rviz``: Contains several `rviz <https://github.com/ros2/rviz>`__ plugins for visualizing and controlling scenarios when working with ROS2.
- ``simulation/gazebo_tf_publisher``: Publish ground truth transforms from simulation within TF.
- ``simulation/tb4_sim_scenario``: Run `Turtlebot4 <https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_simulator.html>`_ within simulation, controlled by scenario execution.
- ``tools/message_modification``: ROS2 nodes to modify messages.
- ``tools/scenario_status``: Publish the current scenario status on a topic (e.g. to be capture within a ROS bag).


Step-based Simulation
---------------------

``scenario_execution`` supports step-based simulators (e.g. MuJoCo, PyBullet, custom hardware-in-the-loop setups) through the :class:`SimulationInterface <scenario_execution.SimulationInterface>` abstraction. This allows scenario authors to run scenarios while retaining full use of the OpenSCENARIO DSL, including time-based directives such as ``wait elapsed()`` and ``timeout()``.

**Clock abstraction**

In normal (wall-clock) mode the framework uses ``time.sleep()`` between ticks. In step-based mode there is no sleeping: the loop runs as fast as the simulator allows. Time is tracked by a :class:`SimulationClock <scenario_execution.SimulationClock>` that advances by exactly ``dt`` seconds per tick, so ``wait elapsed(1s)`` maps to exactly ``1 / dt`` simulation steps regardless of the system clock.

The :class:`WallClock <scenario_execution.WallClock>` is used as fallback when no simulation is configured, preserving backward compatibility.

**API alignment with ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces**

The :class:`SimulationInterface <scenario_execution.SimulationInterface>` is conceptually aligned with the `ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces <https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces>`_ standard, making it straightforward to implement adapters for compliant simulators.

See :ref:`step_based_simulation` for usage instructions and a complete example.
